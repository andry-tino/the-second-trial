\chapter[Study of functions]{Study of two functions}
\label{ch:fun}
\marginnote{Appears as \textit{first problem} in:
LI02, EA02 â€“ Scientific; LI03 - Scientific - Applied Sciences;
LI15 - Scientific - Sport Sciences (standard session)}

This year as well we can find the classic study of function problem. We
are given 2 functions:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{array}{cc}
        f(x) = ax^2 - x + b & g(x) = (ax + b)e^{2x - x^2} \\
    \end{array}
\end{equation*}
Before moving straight on with the questions the problem poses, let's just have
a look at $f$ and $g$ and
classify\sidenote{You need to understand who your enemy is if you
want to fight him and win!}
them. $f$ is a simple algebraic function: a second-order polynomial;
while $g$ is a more sophisticated thing: a transcendental function made up
by the combination of a first-order polynomial and an exponential term. Both
are parametric functions where, in addition to the indipendent variable
$x$, we can see parameters $a$ and $b$.

\paragraph[Problem 1]{Max and min}
\label{par:subp1_1}
\marginnote{\smallcaps{\nameref{par:subp1_1}}}
Considering $a \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{ 0 \}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}$, we
need to show that $g$ has a minimum and maximum (both absolute). I know at
this point you might be tempted to start calculating the first-order
derivative and the studying its sign, but you need to hold that thought
because we can solve this much more
quickly\sidenote{This is not just quicker though, it is much smarter: remember that
the problem does not ask to compute those extema, but to just prove their
existence.} without getting our hands too dirty. 

This is a maximization/minimization problem, therefore we need to
dig in our memory and find out what theorems can help us on this matter.
Weierstrass comes to mind: if we prove that $g$ is continuous inside a
closed interval, then $g$ will attain one minimum and one maximum;
however we do not have a closed interval here, we have the whole
$]-\infty, +\infty[$ so that is not a viable solution.
But we are on the right track here: \textbf{continuity is the key}.
If we can prove that $g$ is \smallcaps{continuous} and
\smallcaps{bounded}\sidenote{A function
$f(x) : \mathbb{R} \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ is bounded in
$x \in [a, b] \subset \mathbb{R}$ when there exist $m, M \in \mathbb{R}$
such that: $m \leq f(x) < M$. Note that the interval can also be
$x \in ]-\infty, +\infty[$.}
in $\mathbb{R}$, then we have
proved\sidenote{A more rigorous proof to why continuous bounded
functions attain extrema can be found at: \nameref{sec:contbound}.}
it has
absolute extrema. Think about it: continuity means that you can draw
$g$ without ever lifting your pen from the paper, the only thing
which can prevent the existence of extrema is if
$\lim_{x \to \infty} g(x) = \infty$.

Let's implement this strategy. Let's first check the domain of $g$
to see whether it is continuous. As stated earlier, this is the product
between two factors: a polynomial (always continuous in $\mathbb{R}$),
and an exponential (also continuous in $\mathbb{R}$). The argument
inside the exponential is another polynomial as well. Therefore
$g$ is defined in all $\mathbb{R}$ without any discontinuities.
We now need to prove $g$ is bounded, let's start on the left:
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{x \to -\infty} g(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} (ax + b)e^{2x - x^2}
\end{equation*}
Remember that $a \neq 0$ which means tht the $x$ inside $ax + b$ is
always gonna be there, hence $\lim_{x \to -\infty} (ax + b) = -\infty$.
And of course the exponential will vanish as its argument tends
to $-\infty$: $\lim_{x \to -\infty} e^{2x - x^2} = 0$. We reach
an undecided form:
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{x \to -\infty} (ax + b)e^{2x - x^2} =
        [-\infty \cdot 0]
\end{equation*}
Solving this indeterminate form can be done quickly by turning it into
a different one. Remember that every product $\alpha \beta$ can be
rewritten as $\frac{\alpha}{\beta^{-1}}$. What's the gain you ask?
If $\alpha \to \infty$ and $\beta \to 0$, then we have transformed a
$[\infty \cdot 0]$ form into a $[\frac{\infty}{\infty}]$.
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{x \to -\infty} (ax + b)e^{2x - x^2} =
    \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{ax + b}{e^{x^2 - 2x}} =
    \left[\frac{\infty}{\infty}\right]
\end{equation*}
What good is this for? Well, now we can use De L\^{o}pital's
theorem\sidenote{When two differetiable
functions $f$ and $g$ are
such that:
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \left[\frac{\infty}{\infty}\right]
\end{equation*}
Then the following holds:
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f^\prime(x)}{g\prime(x)}
\end{equation*}
Note that $c$ can either be a number or $\infty$.}:
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{ax + b}{e^{x^2 - 2x}} =
    \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{(ax + b)^\prime}{\left( e^{x^2 - 2x} \right)^\prime} =
    \lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{a}{(2x - 2)e^{x^2 - 2x}} =
    \left[\frac{1}{\infty}\right] = 0
\end{equation*}
When we move on to take the limit of $g$ to $+\infty$,
the calculations are basically
the same and so is the result: $\lim_{x \to +\infty} g(x) = 0$.
That means the $g$ attains a maximum and a minimum because we just proved this
function is continuous and bounded.

\paragraph[Problem 2]{Parametric problem}
\label{par:subp2_1}
\marginnote{\smallcaps{\nameref{par:subp2_1}}}
As second step, the problem asks us to find the values of $a$ and $b$ such that
$f$ and $g$'s graphs intersect at point $A \equiv (2,1)$.
