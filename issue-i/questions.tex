In this year's exams we can see a nice variaty of topics in the questions
ranging from the main theme: Magnetism to Probability and Linear Algebra.

\section{Extrema finding}
\label{sec:extremafind}
\marginnote{Appears as problem 1 in L 06.}
Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial, the following function is provided:
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = \frac{p(x)}{x^2 + d}
\end{equation*}
Where $d \in \mathbb{R}$. $f$'s plot intersects the x-axis at $x_1 = 0$ and
$x_2 = \frac{12}{5}$, and has these lines as asymptotes: $x=3$, $x=-3$ and
$y=5$. We need to calculate the points of relative maximum and minimum.

\paragraph{}
The first thing important noticing is that $f$ is the ratio between two
polynomials. How much do we know about these two polynomials? The
denominator is a second-degree polynomial, while we do not have much
information about the numerator. We need to know a few things more about
$p$. From what the problem tells us, we know that
$\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) \neq \infty$. That is a very important piece
of data because we know that the ratio between two polynomials tends
to a finite value (as the variable tends to infinity) only when they
have the same
degree\sidenote{The full theorem actually states that:
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{N(x)}{D(x)} = l \neq \infty
        \iff n = m
\end{equation*}
Where $N(x)$ and $D(x)$ are two polynomials with
degrees $n$ and $m$ respectively. And we also have that:
\begin{equation}
    l = \frac{a_N}{a_D}
\end{equation}
Where $a_N$ id $N$'s highest power's coefficient, and
$a_D$ id $D$'s highest power's coefficient.}.
Thanks to it, we can rewrite $f$ as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fracinfty}
    f(x) = \frac{ax^2 + bx + c}{x^2 + d}
\end{equation}
Because of equation \ref{eq:fracinfty}, we have that:
\begin{equation*}
    \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{ax^2 + bx + c}{x^2 + d}
        = \frac{a}{1} = 5
        \implies a = 5
\end{equation*}
As we unveil the values of coefficients, we know more and more the final form
of $f$, and this is important because we will need to compute its derivative and
then study its sign: the less parameters in the derivative, the easier our job.
Now $f$ is:
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = \frac{5x^2 + bx + c}{x^2 + d}
\end{equation*}
We still have 3 parameters.
Let's use the info about intersections with the x-axis to find the values of some
of those:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        &\begin{cases}
            f(0) = 0\\
            f\left( \frac{12}{5} \right) = 0
        \end{cases}
        \implies
        \begin{cases}
            \frac{c}{d} = 0\\
            \frac{5\frac{12^2}{5^2} + b\frac{12}{5} + c}{\frac{12^2}{5^2} + d} = 0
        \end{cases}
        \implies
        \begin{cases}
            c = 0\\
            \frac{\frac{12^2}{5} + b\frac{12}{5}}{\frac{12^2}{5^2} + d} = 0
        \end{cases}
        \implies\\
        &\frac{12^2 + 12b}{5} = 0 \implies
        12 + b = 0 \implies
        b = -12
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Which means now $f$ can be written as:
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = \frac{5x^2 - 12x}{x^2 + d}
\end{equation*}
We only have $d$ left to find out, and for that we can use the information about
the two vertical asymptotes. Remember that $f$ is a ratio, when the denominator
tends to 0, the whole ratio tends to infinity; it means that if we find the
values of $x$ for which $x^2 + d = 0$, we will find the exact points where
the asymptots are: $x^2 + d = 0 \implies x = \pm \sqrt{-d}$. At this point
it becomes clear that $d < 0$ because otherwise we would have no asymptotes as
we would need to extract the square root of a negative number which is not a
real number.
Also notice that $d \neq 0$, otherwise we would not have two different
asymptotes, but only one. Since we know that the two aymptotes are $x = \pm 3$,
we can conclude that: $\pm 3 = \sqrt{-d} \implies d = -9$, and:
\begin{equation*}
    f(x) = \frac{5x^2 - 12x}{x^2 - 9}
\end{equation*}
Now we can compute $f^\prime$:
\begin{equation*}
    f^\prime(x) = \frac{10x - 12}{x^2 - 9} - \frac{5x^2 - 12x}{(x^2 - 9)^2} 2x = \dots =
        6\frac{2x^2 - 15x + 18}{(x^2 - 9)^2}
\end{equation*}
We first need to find the zeros\sidenote{Remember that the zeros
of a fraction $\frac{N(x)}{D(X)}$ can be found by finding the zeros of the numerator $N(x)$.}
of $f^\prime$:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        2x^2 - 15x + 18 = 0 &\implies x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} =
        \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{81}}{4} = \frac{15 \pm 9}{4}\\
        &\implies
        \begin{cases}
            x_1 = \frac{15 + 9}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6\\
            x_2 = \frac{15 - 9}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{2}
        \end{cases}
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
Switching to the corresponding inequality: $2x^2 - 15x + 18 > 0$, we see that
the leading coefficient is positive and the inequality's sign is $>$; as
already stated in \ref{sn:dice}, we have
that: $f^\prime(x) > 0 \iff x < \frac{3}{2} \vee x > 6$.

    \caption{Construction of the final plot.}%
    \label{fig:pr1fplot}%
\end{marginfigure}
%
This confirms that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are extrema (since around them $f^\prime$ changes sign),
and gives us the final result: $x_1$ is a point of relative maximum, while $x_2$ is
a point of relative minimum.

\section{A big polynomial}
\label{sec:bigpoly}
\marginnote{Appears as problem 1 in L 06.}
Let $g(x)$ be the following polynomial:
\begin{equation*}
    g(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^{1010} x^{2n-1} = x + x^3 + x^5 + \dot + x^{2017} + x^{2019}
\end{equation*}
We must prove that $g$ has a single real root. We also need to compute:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:limfracpolyexp}
    \lim_{x \to +\infty} \frac{g(x)}{1.1^x}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{}
The first part of the problem is about proving the \textbf{existence} and \textbf{uniqueness}
of $g$'s real root. In mathematical terms, this is what we need to prove:
\marginnote{You might see logical operator $\exists!$ for the first time: it
simply means: \textit{"there exists only one..."}.}
\begin{equation*}
    \exists! x_0 \in \mathbb{R} : g(x_0) = 0
\end{equation*}
The proof is actually much easier than you can expect. $g$ looks very scary because it's big,
but if we pay attention, we can see that the polynomial is missing the contant term $x^0$.
So we can actually rewrite $g$ by extracting $x$ as:
\begin{equation*}
    g(x) = x \cdot \left(1 + x^2 + x^4 + \dot + x^{2016} + x^{2018} \right)
\end{equation*}
Look now, we have basically applied the following transformation:
\begin{equation*}
    g(x) = \sum_{n = 1}^{1010} x^{2n-1} = x \cdot \sum_{n = 1}^{1009} x^{2n} 
\end{equation*}
At this point it's easy to see there exists only a single real root to $g$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gsumprodzero}
    g(x) = 0 \implies x \cdot \sum_{n = 1}^{1009} x^{2n} = 0
\end{equation}
And that is $x_0 = 0$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item As equation \ref{eq:gsumprodzero} shows, $g$ is the product of two factors: $g$ is
        null when either one of them is null. One of these terms is expression $x$:
        therefore $x = 0$ is a real root. This proves the existence of $x_0$.
    \item The second factor in $g$'s definition as per equation \ref{eq:gsumprodzero},
        is a complete polynomial where all its coefficients are positive and all powers
        are even\sidenote{Expression $2n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$ describes an even number.}.
        This means that the sum we see as second factor is a sum of squares, and
        we know that a sum of squares is never null (for real values). This proves the uniqueness
        of $x_0$.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{}
As for the second part of the problem, the limit in equation \ref{eq:limfracpolyexp} involves
a ratio between a polynomial and an exponential term. It is easy to prove that ratio tends
to $0$ when $x \to +\infty$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We know that an exponential term $a^x$ tends to $+\infty$ as the variable tends
        to $+\infty$ when $a > 1$. Therefore $1.1^x \to +\infty$.
    \item We know that polynomials always tend to $\infty$ when the variable tends to $\infty$.
        In this case, as $x \to +\infty$, $g(x) \to +\infty$ because the leading coefficient
        is positive.
    \item The ratio $\frac{g(x)}{1.1^x}$ tends to $0$ as $x \to +\infty$ because the exponential
        appears as the denominator. An exponential grows to $+\infty$ with an incredible speed.
        A polynomial cannot match that speed. Therefore the denominator grows much more than
        the numerator causing the whole fraction to tend towards $0$.
\end{enumerate}
If we want to be very precise and provide a proof to the last point, we can apply De L\^{o}pital's
theorem\textsuperscript{\ref{sn:dehopital}}. Both functions are
differentiable\sidenote{Actually they are both $\mathcal{C}^\infty$: indefinitely differentiable.},
and they both tend towards $\infty$; so we get the indeterminate
form $\left[ \frac{\infty}{\infty} \right]$. As we apply the rule once, we notice that the
indeterminate form still remains but the polynomial has dropped its order by 1; so we re-apply
the rule (as many time as the original order of the polynomial: $1010$) until we get $0$:
\marginnote{Each arrow indicates an iteration where we take the derivative of the numerator and
the denominator. Also note that $p^{[N]}(x)$ indicates a generic $N$-degree polynomial.}
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{p^{[N]}(x)}{1.1^x} \rightarrow \frac{p^{[N-1]}(x)}{\log(1.1)1.1^x}
        \rightarrow \frac{p^{[N-2]}(x)}{\log^2(1.1)1.1^x} \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow
        \frac{0}{\log^N(1.1)1.1^x} = 0
\end{equation*}
If we run the above process for $N=1010$, we get the result.
