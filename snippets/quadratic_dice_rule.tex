    For any given inequality $ax^2 + bx + c <> 0$, having
    $x_1$, $x_2$ (with $x_1 \leq x_2$) be
    the points such that $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$; the solution is
    $x < x_1 \wedge x > x_2$ if $a > 0$ and the sign is $>$ or if $a < 0$ and the sign is $<$;
    while the solution is $x_1 < x < x_2$
    if $a > 0$ and the sign is $<$ or if $a < 0$ and the sign is $>$.
